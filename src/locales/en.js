  aboutUsDescription: "We are a team of students passionate about video game development and digital art, united by our love for the Made in Abyss universe.",
  aboutUsText1: "Our team consists of Iván, Fan, and Adrián, three students from La Salle Campus Barcelona with different skills but a shared vision: to create immersive experiences that capture the essence of fantastic worlds. Our passion for the 'Made in Abyss' narrative inspired us to develop a platform game that pays homage to its mysterious and captivating universe.",
  aboutUsText2: "In our game, we explore the mysteries of a vertical abyss filled with fascinating creatures, forgotten relics, and breathtaking landscapes. Each level is designed to evoke the sense of discovery and danger that characterizes the original work, challenging players to venture deeper while facing the increasing risks of descent.",
  aboutUsText3: "This project represents not only our dedication to video game development but also our commitment to creating experiences that resonate emotionally with players. Through carefully designed game mechanics, captivating visual aesthetics, and an atmospheric soundtrack, we invite players to immerse themselves in a world where curiosity and adventure go hand in hand with mystery and danger.",
